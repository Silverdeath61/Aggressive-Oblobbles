# Aggressive-Oblobbles
Hollow Knight mod that makes both Oblobbles rage once they enter the arena.

To install this, go to your Steam folder and from there steamapps/common/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight_Data/Managed/ and put it in your Mods folder which you presumably have installed already.

This was made as a project to learn from and to get me back into C#. I don't intend on revisiting this currently. It is rough around the edges and it doesn't have an options page. To turn it off you need to manually remove it from the Mods folder.
